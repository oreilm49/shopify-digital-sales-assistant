<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A digital sales assistant application for Shopify. Ever find yourself purchasing something which you have absolutely no clue about? Maybe a dishwasher, rollerblades or a chick stick for that special someone. Vendy provides an interface to ask you questions about your purchasing decision to guide you to the best fit product! You find what you're looking for faster, and the retailer's conversion rate increases - win win!
